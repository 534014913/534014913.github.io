I recently come across this guide [A Way to Practice Competetive Programming][way] since
I did not participate in any sport for a long time. I decide to have a try with this one. This should also comes handy when I decide to use more Rust, just like what [kenkoooo][kenkoo] did.

The first step the guide suggests is to participate in ABC on AtCoder. I will start with
contest 043 as that is when they introduced question in English. The missing editorial should not be a problem.

I am going to follow the standard procedure, try to tackle a question for 10~15 mins, if I have no clue how to aproach the quesiton, I can ready the editorial. After solving the question, It will be benefitial to have a look at other people's submission to learn their ideas and perhaps some macros.

Once I have some condfidence, The next step is to participate in real contest. I will post details of every contest I tried.
