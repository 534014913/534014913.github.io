- A: simple geometry
- B: simple simulation, but there's some elegent solutions [kelvin090228][link]
- C: to my surprise, I figured it out. It's like a OK level question or maybe I am lucky this time.
Section 7,8 of the book Programming Abstractions in C++ helped me inmensely. It is the text book
used in the course CS106B, the course is also pure gold.
- D: some kind of smart brute force. you need to reduce the number of coordinates you examine. [good example][link2]

PS: I remember the first lecture on recursion at Imperial, the lecturer mentioned how to take the recursive leap of faith
and gave an example on how to calculate `pow` using recursion, that's it. It's sad when I compare the content to what one can read from the CS106B slides + the book.

PPS: I met some french intern at Qube today, some of them are from ecole polytechnique. I want to visit X some day.
