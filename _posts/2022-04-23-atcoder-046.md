- A: logic
- B: the compiler is strange for this one. this works
`int ans = pow(k-1, n -1) * n; cout << ans << endl;`, this does not
`cout << pow(k - 1, n - 1) * n << endl;`
- C: math, start with vote number == initial input, then if any subsequent pair of input is less than any of the current value
multiply both number by the later ratio (vote number / input)
- D: A math/logic question. let me try to translate the editorial for this question since google translate has information missing.
	1. As a base case, let's start with playing rock('g') every term, our score will be -(number of 'p's in the input string), now let's think about how can we change some of the 'g' in our base case into 'p' to inprove the score
	2. - case one: at the turn we select to change 'g' to 'p', our opponent played 'g' then our score is increaed by one since we are able to win at this turn (0 -> 1)
	   - case two: at the turn ..., our opponent played 'p', our score is also increased by one as we tie instead of losing this round (-1 -> 0)
	3. since in both cases, we increase the score by one, it does not matter which turns we choose, the result will be the same as playing "gp gp gp gp ...", therefore since we can play at most floor(N / 2) 'p's, max score can be achieved will be -(number of 'p's) + floor(N / 2)

PS: Today is world book day, I just want list some of the book I plan to read, some of then are from [haodoo.net][link].
