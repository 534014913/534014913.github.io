- A: check 3 possibilities
- B: use bottom-left and top-right to model to the remaining white circle, based on the value of a(if a == 1 and x read in is between b-l and t-r, we need to reduce the size of the remaining square accordingly, if x read in is greater than t-r.x, we have no white sqaure left, etc. for other values of a). simulation problem.
- C: number of changes from 'B' to 'W' and from 'W' to 'B'.
- D: Takahashi will always buy one town and sell at another to achieve max profix, similar to this [LeetCode 121][link], when Aoki change one value, if there is other possible pair of towns to achieve this max profit, Tak will choose that pair instead, so Aoki need to make price change to all pairs of town that can achieve this max profit, i.e. we are counting the number of pairs of town that can achieve this max profit.

PS: If you are using vscode, there is a color theme I would like to suggest, it's called Mariana, it's the default color theme on Sublime Text. I could not work out how to use Sublime Text properly so I installed one on vscode. It's so much more readable than those themes that gets millions fo downloads, e.g. One Dark Pro. It's surreal.
