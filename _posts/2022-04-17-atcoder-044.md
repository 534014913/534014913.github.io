- A: arithmetic
- B: counting
- C: takes a long time to think through. there is a lot a still don't understand, will come back to this question. I need to improve knapsack problem skill.
- D: I had to read the editorial and other submission as well for this problem. I am still unsure why to divide into 2 cases
b > sqrt(n) and b <= sqrt(n), maybe just some clever observation

PS: I should not make my life harder by trying to allocate array dynamically.
Allocating them as a long enough static array is good enough at this stage.

PPS: Good resource for learning questions similar to question C [背包问题九讲][link]

PPPS: The quality of translation generated from goodle translate is very good. I am amazed. The Japanese version of the editorial on Atcoder is much more useful, I should read more of them using google translate.
