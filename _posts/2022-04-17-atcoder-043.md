A: sum of some arithmetic progression
B: simple string manipulation
C: brute force
D: I read the question wrong for this one, I thought I need to construct a map or something, but it turns out the question can be break down to 2 cases
- case 1: consider 2 consecutive letters, if they are the same we have an unbalanced string.
- case 2: consider 3 letters, letter 0 and letter 2 are the same, we have an unbalanced string, all other unbalanced string are constructed base on this two cases

I dont think I need to do any clever tricks to speed up the solution, as long as I got the behaviour of the solution right, it's AC
