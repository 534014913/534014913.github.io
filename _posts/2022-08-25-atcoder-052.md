- A: IO
- B: String & IO
- C: each N can be factorised as product of primes `p1^m + p2^n ....` and the number of factors is `(m+1) * (n+1) * ... `. since we are finding the number of factors for `N!`. we need to find the number of each prime factor for each number between 2 and N, then multiply then (`(pf[i] + 1) * ... * (pf[N] + 1)`) to get the answer.
- D: compare the cost for traveling and teleporting at Xi to Xi+1, select the minimum cost each time
